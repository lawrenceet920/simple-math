## Writing Your Code

- Add a comment block to the top of your script
- Declare (create) two variables, `num1` and `num2`, and assign a different number (numeric value) to each
- Then use the two variables to perform the following calculations:
    - addition
    - subtraction
    - multiplication
    - division
    - modulus (finding the remainder -- if there is one -- for a division problem)
- Name the variables that will store the result of each calculation like this:
    - `sum`
    - `difference`
    - `product`
    - `quotient`
    -`remainder`
- Write a formula to perform each calculation
- Use the `print( )` function and an `f-string` to display the values used, the formula used for the calculation, and the result/answer.

```python
# Create and assign a numeric value to each variable
num1 = 5
num2 = 2

# Formula to do the multiplication
product = num1 * num2

# Show the output (answer)
print(f'{num1} times {num2} = {product}')
```
