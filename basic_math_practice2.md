### Area Calculation

- Write a script that lets you calculate the area (in square feet) of a rectangular room, such as your kitchen or living room  

- Use the built-in `input( )` function to make the script interactive  

    - Prompt the user to enter the LENGTH of the rectangular room (in feet)
    - Prompt the user to enter the WIDTH of the rectangular room (in feet)
    - TIP: Since the length or width of a room can be a number such as 10 or 10.50 or 12.75, tell Python to treat the length and width of the room as **floating-point** numbers  

- Calculate and display the area of the rectangular room (in square feet)  

- Include the correct units -- feet and square feet -- for the prompts and for the output  

- Search online for the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle if you can't remember the formula
