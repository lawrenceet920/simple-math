### Practice 3: Formatting Numeric Output

When you do math in Python, sometimes you want to display the results of your calculations in a certain way.  

For example, you want the numbers that are part of your output to:

* contain a decimal point
* display two places after the decimal point

You might do something like this when working with prices or calculating the area of different shapes.

Review the sample code below and let me know if you have any questions about how to format your numbers in Python.

### Part 1

Use the string `format ( )` method to build and output a string that displays your first name, age, and your favorite color.

Use *positional key arguments* to control where in the string Python inserts each piece of data, i.e., your name, age, and favorite color.

### Part 2

Write a simple script that calculates and displays the *state sales tax* and *grand total* for a grocery order of three (3) items.

Assume the *state sales tax* rate is 6.00%.  (Use 0.06 to represent the sales tax rate in your code.)

Format your output as currency (with a '$' and two places after the decimal point).  

See the first resource on this page for an example of how to format your output in this way.

### Part 3

Use the string `format ( )` method to build and output a string that displays your friend's first name and the name of the school they attend.
